# Jar
Put a dollar in the jar discord bot. This is a very light bot that you can call to put a dollar in a far for yourself or for someone else. 
Each dollar must be labeled with what was said which deserved the dollar, or you can just state REDACTED if you really don't want to resay it... There is a character limit of 200.
The jarDB SQLite database will keep track of each dollar put in the jar, the text added, who put it in, who it was assigned to, and when it was assigned. Then you can throw a couple of commands to pull stats from the database

COMMANDS:
/jar : pulls up two buttons to add a dollar for yourself (self report) or for someone else (Report for someone else)
/jar_stats : select user to see how many dollars they have in the jar

Future commands:
/jar_reported : See the list of all dollars put in the jar for a specific user
/jar_submission : See all submissions made by a user
/jar_scoreboard : list all of the users and dollar amounts in descending order
maybe more?
